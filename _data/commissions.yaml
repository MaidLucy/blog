    A friend of mine was trying to convince me to put a santa hat on my profile picture.
    So I commissioned another artwork of my OC in a christmas version.
    It was now May 2023 as I write this and I it is still my profile picture and smartphone wallpaper because I love it so much!

    I was feeling really emotional when I had this idea.
    It is some kind of coping.
    I wanted to see my internet self crying, just like I cried a lot at that time.

    This is the first commission of my OC.
    During a very dark time, this truly was an enlightening moment.
    I love this artwork so much.
    Thanks to [HaeliHarlekin](twitch.tv/haeliharlekin) I finally decided to make Maid Lucy happen.
    Thank you for inspiring me!
