Free speech on the internet is *dead*.
The definition of free speech, that everyone can say anything as long as it does not hurt anybody else, does not apply on the internet anymore.
The reasoning for that is simple:

The internet is capable of reaching almost half of the human population in less than a single second.
Therefore, no matter what you publish on the internet, there is going to be a person that is going to be hurt by it.
Essentially, you cannot say anything on the internet without the possibility of hurting someone, even if you have never been in contact with that person before.

If you want to apply the principle of free speech after considering this fact, you cannot say anything on the internet anymore.
If you think that this is wrong, just do not think about the people who might get hurt, because there is definietly someone, *just say it*.
And live with the consequences.
