Here's a summary of all the male to female transgender voice tutorials I found on YouTube.

## Getting started on Lyrinx-Control

This video helped a lot to learn about efficient ways to control the lyrinx.

It inclused a warmup that you can do before practicing. Not much detail about resonance and how to turn the humming into a voice though.

## Formal

There's also the possibility to read about it in formal medical literature if you can access that.
Chapter 12 of [Transgender Medicine: A Multidisciplinary Approach](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-05683-4) talks about it in a lot of detail.

## You can do it!

You have more control over your voice than you think you do!

Cheers,<br>
