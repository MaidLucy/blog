This will be a very lengthy post about how I finally got HRT in germany,
why I didn't initally plan to do it immediatly,
what kind of problems did arise on the way
and the mess that I'm now left with afterwards.

## How to HRT in Germany

First up will be a brief description about how this process usually works in germany, in general.

1. Aquire a diagnosis in form of indication for hormone replacement theraphy by a theraphist or psychatrist.

There isn't really a standard on how to write this document,
but experienced mental health professionals can usually write this up after one or two sessions with them.

2. Find a doctor that prescribes you HRT and can take care of your bloodlevels to adjust your dosis properly.

Usually any doctor can prescribe you HRT without getting into trouble,
but as your bloodlevels need to get checked regularly, it makes a lot of sense to consult a specialist for hormones (an endocrinogist) for this matter.

3. (Optional) As an MtF patient, your insurance *should* cover a sperm-cryopreservation as well.

If you'd like to have childrend at some point, this probably easier to do than adopting a child later on.
So if insurance covers it, why not.
Well, this step has caused most problems for me, you'll read more about it later.

4. Receive a recipe!

Yay, you have done it, you are now getting HRT in germany!!

## Diagnosis

So the first step is usually finding a therapist that will write you an indication in a timely manner.
Not all therapists know how to avoid gatekeeping you though
and some of them don't even know anything about the subject.
So it makes a lot of sense to ask your local trans-self-support group for some advice on which ones to avoid
and where you can get an indication easily.

As for me, I already had a great theraphist at the time.
After some initial confusion about the topic
– I was the first trans-patient for them –
they said, they'd write me an indication.
They were really excited to help me out there and did also gender me correctly without me even bringing it up myself.
There was also a lot of time to write the indication for her for reasons you'll later read about.

## Finding an Endocrinologist

Finding an endocrinologist was probably the 2nd hardest thing about this journey.
Already being connected to the local self-support-group, I was told two places in my city
– let's call them place 1 and place 2 –
that were able to do hormone replacement theraphy.

I immediatly tried to make an appointment at place 2,
because every said that they were far better than place 1
and most of the trans-woman in my city are there.

Unfortunatly, the hormone-doctor situation in my city has become pretty bad around that time.
Some places closed only to privately insured patients, some closed all together.
So there was really only one place left that was not part of a hospital, that's place 1.

Therefore, after calling place 2 for two weeks and not being able to get through,
I decided to there in person to make an appointment.
It was close to my home anyways.
Well, I got an appointment, but it was for April 2025.

Mind you, it was April 2024 when I went there.
I would have problably not made it through until then, so I also made an appointment at place 1.
The appointment I got there was in September 2024, so that's also a 5 month wait time.

I wasn't even really sure if I'd want to actually do HRT at that point, I wanted to talk to a doctor first and foremost.
But this experience alone was such a frustrating one and it shows that our local insurance is not really doing a great job at supplying this city with enough health-services.

I told myself ot chill down a bit, after all the most stressful part of the semester was to come up.
And after that I had planned two amazing holidays where I could relax myself from the matter.

## Experience at Place 1

People had already told me a lot of bad stuff about this place, hence why I wanted to avoid it.
But any HRT is better than none until the time I could find a better doctor.
Also, they'd just prescribe you the medications at the reception once you'd get them and you essentially do what you want from that point onwards.
Not all too bad.

Well, the badness did arise as my name was called uppon waiting in the waiting room.
I was dressed femme, I even had eyeliner on
and the doctor that was responsible for me still called me "mister lastname" when they went to pick me up at the waiting room.

Not up to a great start.
But it wouldn't get better from there:

She essentially just explained that we're only taking baseline blood levels today
and I should come back when I have an indication.

I told her I already have an indication, she looked for about 3 seconds, handed it back to me
and said that I should get one from a psychiatrist.
My theraphist, mind you, **is a psychiastrist**.

She also handed me a handout about the effects of HRT (MtF) which talked about voice changes.
That should give you an indication at how little these people there cared about transgender patients.

The sperm-cryopreservation that should be covered by my insurance wasn't even mentioned,
let alone the fact that I'll get infertile from it.

Blood levels were taken and I got come back when I have a indication.

## Aftermath of Place 1

After two weeks I went there again, asked for the blood test results, which were just about ready.
I got told that something is wrong with my blood levels and that I should do another test.
For which I got an appointment at the laboratory at the **end of fucking october**.

Well, not much I could do about that.

I then also asked for a transferral thingy for a sperm-cryopreservation.
The person at the counter was a bit confused at first but in the end I got what I needed,
to get this covered by my insurance.

I wasn't planning to start HRT there after that initial experience,
but I still told them I now have a new indication now and she scanned that.
A friend told me about a place 3 that now also does HRT here, and I was about to make an apointment there as well.

## Finding a place that does sperm-cryopreservation

This was **by far** the hardest part.

So, I found out there's two places in my city that do that.
Let's also call them cryo place 1 and cryo place 2.

I first called cryo place 1, asked for an appointment because I got a transferral thingy,
and got told that they don't cover that with insurance in my case.
I still made an appointment and thought I could deal with the fact that they don't know later.

After three exhausting calls and a lot of discussion on the phone,
I had to cancel the appointment, because I couldn't provide what they wanted from my insurance and doctor
and the price that I would have to pay was simply put, more than I could afford.

In those phonecalls I also got told that this isn't a treatment that makes infertile and therefor I had to pay myself,
absolute bullshit.
Peak gatekeeping.

There was a chance that I could get it back from my insurance, but that was very risky and I would have to go into debt, to do that.

Completely insance if you'll take into account what my insurance had to say to that.
We'll cover that later, in chronolocial order.

## Experience at Place 3

Place 3 did have an appointment in about 2 months for me, which they already considered a long waiting time,
but in my opinion it was worth the wait.
A new doctor would be more motivated to do this and there was more room for discussion, is what I hoped.

I was very delighted after getting called "miss" after signing up at the reception.
They told me that their IT system isn't capably of noting another name and gender than what is on my electronic insurance card.
They continued to gender my right and every instance apologized about it, very heartwarming.

The doctor there took a whole 30 minutes to talk to me on an insanely busy day.
The first thing she brought up was that I'll get infertile.

I then told her the whole story I had encountered until now
and asked if she could help me with the an indication that says that I'll get infertile from it.
She said she couldn't write anything specific for that, but that the letter that I'll receive from her will explain that I'll make infertile anyways.

She also didn't know how this should get covered by insurance.
I then explained to her, what I had found up until then.

All in all that was a great experience.
She said I should call or come back again when I have figured the cryopreservation out
and then I'll get a precription.

## Asking the Insurance Part 1

Now after all those conflicts
